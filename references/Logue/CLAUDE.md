# Logue — Development Guidelines

## Project Overview

macOS app (macOS 26+ / Tahoe): AI-powered meeting notes + document editing. Privacy-first — all AI inference, transcription, and data processing runs locally on-device via MLX. By default nothing leaves the laptop; the only network calls are on-device model downloads, Sparkle update checks, and opt-in features the user explicitly enables (web search, external AI providers).

- **Bundle ID:** `com.bitwize.logue`
- **Source:** `Logue/`, **Tests:** `LogueTests/`
- **Swift 5.9 + SwiftUI + AppKit**
- **Build system:** XcodeGen — run `xcodegen generate` after adding new `.swift` files or changing `project.yml`
- **Build (runnable):** `xcodebuild build -project Logue.xcodeproj -scheme Logue -destination 'platform=macOS' DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=HC5R66SXM5 CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Automatic`
- **Build / test (compile-check only):** append `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=""`
- **MLX prerequisite:** `xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain`
- **Test (LLM integration):** `xcodebuild test -project Logue.xcodeproj -scheme Logue -destination 'platform=macOS' -only-testing:LogueTests/<SuiteName>`

> **`xcodebuild` with no signing arguments fails**, and the error — `"Logue" has entitlements that
> require signing with a development certificate` — reads like a code error rather than a missing
> flag. `project.yml` ships `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM: ""` deliberately, so the team is passed on the
> command line and never committed.

## Running the build you just made

Three separate things will each hand you a *different* build than the one you compiled, and all
three fail silently — the app launches, looks right, and simply does not contain your change. Every
"my edit isn't showing up" report so far has been one of these, not a bug in the code.

- **Never pick the app by timestamp.** More than one DerivedData root exists for this project (the
  command line's and Xcode's). Ask the build system where it writes, rather than guessing:

  ```bash
  APP=$(xcodebuild -project Logue.xcodeproj -scheme Logue -configuration Debug \
    -destination 'platform=macOS' -showBuildSettings 2>/dev/null \
    | awk -F' = ' '/ BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR /{print $2; exit}')/Logue.app
  ```

- **`open` may launch a different copy.** LaunchServices resolves by bundle identifier, so with a
  release build installed in `/Applications`, `open <path-to-dev-build>` can start — or merely
  re-activate — the installed one instead. Quit every running instance first, then exec the binary
  directly, in its own session so it outlives the shell that started it:

  ```bash
  pkill -x Logue; sleep 2
  "$APP/Contents/MacOS/Logue" &
  ```

- **Confirm what is running, by process, not by path you passed.**

  ```bash
  PID=$(pgrep -x Logue); ps -p $PID -o args=          # which bundle
  lsof -p $PID | grep Logue.debug.dylib               # which code, actually loaded
  ```

  `Contents/MacOS/Logue` is a ~60 KB stub; the app's code lives in `Contents/MacOS/Logue.debug.dylib`.
  Searching the stub for a string you just added always comes back empty and proves nothing.

**Rebuilding revokes Screen Recording permission.** macOS ties that grant to the code signature, so
each rebuild drops it and system-audio capture stops until Logue is re-enabled under System Settings
→ Privacy & Security → Screen Recording. A signed release build keeps a stable signature and does not
have this problem.

## Where documentation goes

- **`docs/specs/`** — design and specification documents. Checked in.
- **`docs/plans/`** — implementation plans and other working notes. **Deliberately gitignored**;
  they are scaffolding for building the thing, not part of it. Do not move a plan into `docs/specs/`
  to get it committed, and do not `git add -f` it.
- `.gitignore` ignores `docs/*` wholesale and then re-admits specific subdirectories, so **a new
  documentation directory is invisible to git until `.gitignore` re-admits it.** Check with
  `git check-ignore -v <path>` before assuming a doc was committed.

## Architecture

### Audio Pipeline (live capture streams directly; the post-recording pass chunks)

- `AudioRecorder` — mic capture, raw `AVAudioPCMBuffer` via callback
- `SystemAudioCapture` — ScreenCaptureKit system audio, `CMSampleBuffer` → `AVAudioPCMBuffer`
- `BufferConverter` — `AVAudioConverter` wrapper for format conversion
- `SpeechTranscriberEngine` — streams raw audio → `SpeechAnalyzer` → `TranscriptSegment`
- `RecordingSessionManager` — orchestrates engines + diarization; uses `RecordingState` enum (`.idle`, `.starting`, `.recording`, `.stopping`)
- `AudioTimelineMixer` — the session's audio on one 16 kHz timeline; each source writes at its own
  cursor and overlaps are summed, so an hour of meeting is an hour of buffer however many sources run
- `DiarizationManager` — FluidAudio wrapper; streaming Sortformer (primary) + batch accumulation
  fallback. Past what memory holds, the post-recording pass reads the saved file back in chunks
  (`+LongRecording`) instead of stopping

### Recording invariants

Two rules the recording path depends on, both learned the hard way:

- **A pass may only speak for the audio it actually heard.** The post-recording batch transcription
  replaces the live transcript, so it is bounded to the stretch it covered (`TranscriptReplacement`).
  Covering the session means *both* that the file lines up with it and that it is long enough to be
  it — alignment alone let a truncated file delete an hour of correct live transcript.
- **The saved audio file is the meeting's timeline.** A source records only while it runs, so its
  raw file is shorter than the meeting after a mute or a late join. `CaptureSegmentTimeline` records
  where each activation belongs and the file is rewritten to match. Whether that succeeded is
  *reported* by `persistRecordingAudio` (`SavedRecording`), never re-derived afterwards — a capture
  device's clock resets on every toggle, so anything inferred from it is wrong in exactly the cases
  that produce a misaligned file.

### LLM Engine

- `LLMEngine` (actor) — centralized inference, serialized via `inferenceGate`. Core: `complete(system:prompt:)`. Convenience: `generate()`, `chat()`, `analyzeRaw()`, `rephrase()` (in extension files). Also hosts LangGraph writing-agent nodes and streaming analysis. All extension methods MUST route through `complete()`/`completeStream()`.
- `LLMEngineStatus` (@MainActor @Observable) — singleton busy flag (`isBusy`) driven by `LLMEngine.inferenceQueueDepth`. UI views use `.disabled(LLMEngineStatus.shared.isBusy)` to prevent concurrent AI operations.
- `ModelManager` (@MainActor @Observable) — model downloads, activation, endpoint scanning (split: +Download, +Discovery, +HuggingFace)

### Ask Logue invariants (two surfaces, one assistant)

Ask Logue is reachable from two places — the pane in the main window and the Command
Center island floating over another app. They were built separately and drifted: the island
was a bare `chatStream` call with no tools, no memory, no attachments and nothing kept, while
the same question asked from the app got the full agent. **Which window you asked from
decided what Logue was.** These rules exist so that cannot happen again.

- **Which pipeline answers a question is decided in one pure place.** `AskRouter.route(for:)`
  returns agent loop, Deep Research or ImagePlayground. It is a pure function of its inputs —
  no SwiftUI, no `UserDefaults`, no classifier call — so the matrix is testable without a
  view or a model. A decision made inside a `View` is a decision the other surface cannot
  reach, which is exactly how the island ended up with no routing at all.
- **A route is never a function of the surface.** `AskSurface` says which window asked, and
  it is deliberately not an input to `route`. `AskRouteTests` asserts this, so adding it
  later fails the suite rather than silently reintroducing the split.
- **Live run state belongs to a conversation, not to the app.** `AgentRunState` scopes
  `isProcessing`, `isStreaming`, `streamingText`, `activeToolCalls` and `lastError` to the
  conversation that started the run. A global flag means a run on one surface paints its
  spinner, its streaming text and its tool cards onto the other's thread. This holds for
  *every* pipeline, not only the agent loop: `DeepResearchCoordinator` runs one at a time
  app-wide, which is precisely what made a global `isRunning` look sufficient for as long as
  only one surface could start a run. It owns `runningConversationID` and is read through
  `isRunning(in:)`.
- **What the agent did is part of the answer.** Both surfaces render tool calls from
  `AgentToolTimeline`, which pairs a call with the result that answers it and settles what to
  show when the stored status and the result disagree. The island hid tool turns entirely,
  which was fine while it had no tools and became the island claiming credit for work it
  would not show.
- **An error outlives its run but never its owner.** `lastError` persists after the run ends,
  so the banner survives until acknowledged — which is why `conversationID` survives
  `finish()` too. An error with no owner paints on every surface.
- **Anything added to one surface is added to both.** The composer, the conversation view and
  the error banner are *mounted* by both, never redrawn per surface. A feature that exists in
  one window and not the other is the bug this section is about.

### Data Layer

- `MeetingStore` (@MainActor @Observable) — encrypted JSON persistence (split: +AI, +Diarization, +Metadata, +Persistence, +Search, +SeedData, +WelcomeMeeting, Protocols)
- `MeetingNote` (struct, Codable, Sendable) — segments, speakers, speakerSegments, hasSpeakerData
- `EncryptionManager` — AES-256-GCM at rest, 7-day migration window for legacy unencrypted data
- `DocumentStorage` (@MainActor @Observable) — the only thing that knows *where* documents live: encrypted JSON, or plain `.md` files in `~/Logue` (split: +Rescan)

### Document Storage Modes

Documents have two storage modes; meetings only ever have one (encrypted). Off by default,
opt-in under Settings → Privacy.

**When plain markdown storage is on, the file IS the document.** There is no second copy and
nothing to reconcile. Rules that follow from that, all of which have bitten:

- **A scan updates the app and writes nothing back.** A write would produce a filesystem event,
  which produces a scan, which produces a write. The only exception is stamping `_logue_id` into
  a file dropped in by hand, without which every scan adopts it again.
- **A space's folder is found by its identity, never by recomputing a path from its name.**
  `SpaceFolderMap` resolves both directions from the `_logue_space_id` in `_space.md`. Deriving
  paths from names meant a folder the app spells differently (`-Work`, >60 chars) never matched
  its own space, which read as "no folder", which deleted the space and everything in it.
- **A living folder must never read as deleted.** `vanishedSpaceIDs` requires the folder to be
  absent by *both* the identity index and a path check, because anything that stops us reading
  `_space.md` is not evidence the folder is gone.
- **Nothing hard-deletes a file the user can see.** `trashItem`, never `removeItem` — a wrong
  decision should cost a trip to the Trash, not their text.
- **Ambiguity is never resolved by guessing.** Two files claiming one document means nothing is
  applied to that document at all; two folders claiming one space keeps the one the space is
  named after. Both are logged.
- **A plan is diffed against a snapshot, so re-check before applying.** Reading happens off the
  main actor and the user can type during it; `discardingUpdatesThatMovedOn` holds back anything
  that changed.
- **Structural changes made in the app write to disk immediately** (create/rename/move/delete a
  space). That is what earns a scan the right to read a missing folder as a deletion.
- **A missing root folder means do nothing.** An unmounted drive, a moved folder and an
  unfinished sync are indistinguishable from "everything was deleted".

### Tests (Swift Testing framework — @Suite, @Test, #expect, NOT XCTest)

- 94 `@Test` methods across 9 files in `LogueTests/LLMIntegration/`
- `LLMTestHarness.swift` — shared harness with `LenientSuggestionItem`, `repairTruncatedJSON()`, `stripMarkdownFences()`
- Tests run real inference against local MLX model
- Grammar suite uses 10-minute timeout; all others 5 minutes

## Code Standards (Enforced by Review)

### Security

- **Never use `[0]` on FileManager URL arrays.** Use `.first ?? URL.temporaryDirectory` — the array can be empty on edge-case system configurations.
- **Always wrap user content in XML delimiters** when injecting into LLM prompts:
  - Meeting transcripts → `<transcript>...</transcript>`
  - Document content → `<content>...</content>`
  - PII categories → `<categories>...</categories>`
  - This applies to ALL prompt construction — summaries, titles, chat, search, fact-check, vocabulary, PII detection, space suggestions. No exceptions.
- **Require HTTPS for all user-supplied endpoints** (except localhost/127.0.0.1). Validate before saving.
- **Sanitize all user-provided strings** (titles, keywords, model names, space names) before embedding in LLM prompts — truncate length, strip control characters. Use the pattern: `String($0.prefix(N)).filter { !$0.isNewline && $0.asciiValue != 0 }`
- **Use regex validation for structured input** (email, OTP, API keys) — never rely on `contains("@")` or length-only checks.
- **Log URLs with `url.host` only** — never log `url.absoluteString` anywhere in the codebase. This includes error handlers (`didFailProvisionalNavigation`, `didFail`), not just success paths.
- **URL-encode user-supplied path parameters** before interpolating into API endpoint strings. Use `.addingPercentEncoding(withAllowedCharacters: .urlPathAllowed)` to prevent path traversal.
- **Keychain is only for secrets.** Store only sensitive data in Keychain (user-supplied external-API keys). Public keys and non-secret configuration go in `UserDefaults` — simpler and no Keychain permission issues. All AI inference is on-device; external API providers are optional and their keys are user-supplied.
- **Sparkle EdDSA private key** lives only in the GitHub Actions secret `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY` — never store it in the repo. The public key (`SUPublicEDKey`) is embedded in `Info.plist` via `project.yml`. Updates are served entirely from GitHub (appcast in-repo, assets on GitHub Releases) — there is no backend.
- **Use typed constants for notification userInfo keys** — never string literals like `"success"` in `userInfo` dictionaries.
- **Entitlements:**
  - **App Sandbox is OFF in both Debug and Release — do not re-enable it.** A sandboxed process cannot be an Accessibility API client, so macOS never lists the app under Privacy & Security → Accessibility and the user cannot add it manually. That silently kills every `Logue/CrossApp` feature (⌘⌃I inline assistant, global hotkeys, Command Center, text replacement). This shipped in 1.0.0 as issue #22. Guarded by `LogueTests/ReleaseEntitlementsTests.swift` and a CI step.
  - Distribution is Developer ID + notarization via GitHub Releases and Sparkle — not the Mac App Store — so the sandbox is not required. **Hardened Runtime stays ON.**
  - Sparkle needs no XPC services or `SUEnableInstallerLauncherService` when unsandboxed; those exist solely to work around the sandbox.
  - Debug (`Logue.entitlements`) and Release (`Logue.release.entitlements`) still differ: Debug carries the iCloud entitlements, Release does not.
  - Every security exception (`allow-jit`, `disable-library-validation`, etc.) must have a comment explaining why it's needed

### Concurrency and Thread Safety

- **LLMEngine is an actor but Swift actors are reentrant.** Use `inferenceGate` serialization pattern — capture the current gate, create a new task that chains onto it, and assign the new gate synchronously (before any suspension point). Both `complete()` and `completeStream()` participate in the same gate chain. Never assume actor methods run atomically across suspension points.
- **ALL inference MUST route through `complete()` or `completeStream()`.** Never call `session.streamResponse()` or `session.messages` directly from extension methods — this bypasses the `inferenceGate` and causes session races when multiple AI features run concurrently. Extension methods (grammar, clarity, tone, rephrase) should build system/user prompt strings and delegate to `complete()`.
- **Always add `@unchecked Sendable` safety documentation.** Every usage must have a comment explaining what provides thread-safety (lock, dispatch queue, immutability).
- **Always add `nonisolated(unsafe)` documentation.** Explain why the marker is needed and what guarantees safety.
- **Re-check state after async permission checks.** Recording/mic state may change during the `await` — always re-validate with a guard after resuming.
- **Use `RecordingState` enum** (`.idle`, `.starting`, `.recording`, `.stopping`) — never use separate boolean flags for state machines.
- **Use `[weak self]` in all Task closures** except when `self` is a singleton AND the task is trivially short. When in doubt, use `[weak self]`.
- **Use version counters instead of boolean flags** to suppress feedback loops in `onChange` handlers. Booleans reset via `Task { flag = false }` race with rapid state changes; counters don't. Sync `lastSeenVersion = currentVersion` in the handler that **increments** the counter (not in the handler that reads it), so subsequent legitimate changes are not blocked.
- **Check `Task.isCancelled` between expensive resource allocations.** Insert cancellation guards between session creation and prewarm, between model download and activation, etc.

### Error Handling

- **Never use silent `try?` for ANY operation.** This includes file I/O, directory creation, network requests, and data decoding. Use `do/catch` with logging. In static initializers where no Logger instance is available, use `os_log(.error, ...)`. **Exception:** `try? await Task.sleep(for:)` is acceptable — it only throws `CancellationError`, and silencing cancellation is idiomatic in Swift Concurrency.
- **Always use `withRetry()` / `withRetryOptional()`** from `RetryHelper.swift` instead of manual `for attempt in 1...3` loops.
- **Log LLM JSON decode failures** with the error message AND truncated raw response. Silent `try? JSONDecoder()` makes debugging impossible.
- **Add timeout guards to all polling/busy-wait loops.** Use `ContinuousClock.now + .seconds(N)` — never busy-wait indefinitely.
- **Validate array bounds before subscripting** in callbacks and closures where data may have changed since the closure was created. Use `guard index < array.count` before `array[index]`.

### LLM Integration

- **Validate context window before ALL LLM calls.** Truncate input to fit `maxKVSize - outputTokens - promptOverhead`. This applies to: summaries, chat, titles, vocabulary enhancement, fact-check, PII detection, space suggestion, document chat, grammar, clarity, tone, rephrase, `generate()`. The pattern: `let maxChars = ((LLMEngine.mlxParameter.parameters.maxKVSize ?? 16384) - reservedTokens) * 4`. Use `LLMEngine.maxInputChars(reservedTokens:)` or the private `truncatedContext(_:reservedTokens:)` helper in extension files.
- **Always pass explicit `maxTokens`** to `completeStream()` calls — the default (512) is too low for chat responses. Use `maxTokens: 2048` for conversational AI.
- **Rate-limit inference calls.** Use `maxInferenceQueueDepth` to reject calls when the queue is too deep (prevents GPU memory thrashing during bulk operations).
- **Retry with stricter format instructions** when JSON parse fails before falling back to plain-text. Add "IMPORTANT: You MUST output ONLY a valid JSON object" on retry.
- **Check available memory before loading models.** Use `mach_task_basic_info` to verify at least 512MB available — reject with clear error if insufficient.
- **Limit collection sizes in prompts.** Cap space descriptions at 10, content titles at 5, keywords at 5. Large collections exhaust context window.
- **Validate LLM output against source document.** When the LLM returns text that maps back to the document (e.g., vocabulary `original`, suggestion `original`), verify the text actually exists in the document body (case-insensitive) before presenting to the user. Discard hallucinated items that don't match.
- **Use `LLMEngineStatus.shared.isBusy`** to disable AI-triggering UI controls while inference is in progress. This prevents concurrent AI operations that could race on the LLM session. Add `.disabled(LLMEngineStatus.shared.isBusy)` to all buttons that trigger `LLMEngine.complete()` or `completeStream()`.

### Data and Persistence

- **Use `decodeIfPresent` with defaults** for array fields in Codable types (`segments`, `actionItems`, etc.). Never use bare `try container.decode()` for fields that could be missing in older data formats.
- **Encryption migration window is 7 days** (not 30). After that, unencrypted fallback is permanently disabled.
- **Use hash-based change detection** for `didSet` cache invalidation on large arrays — avoid invalidating on every property mutation.

### Code Organization

- **All delay constants go in `AppConstants.Delays`** — never hardcode `Task.sleep(for: .seconds(2))` or `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.3)` inline.
- **Large service classes must use extension files.** Pattern: `FooManager.swift` (core) + `FooManager+Feature.swift` (extensions). Each under ~500 lines.
  - `MeetingStore` → 8 extension files (+AI, +Diarization, +Metadata, +Persistence, +Search, +SeedData, +WelcomeMeeting, Protocols)
  - `ModelManager` → +Download, +Discovery, +HuggingFace
- **Extension-visible members:** When splitting a class into extension files, Swift requires `private` members to become `internal` for cross-file access. Mark these with `// Extension-visible: +FileName` comments explaining which extensions need access. Do not call extension-visible members from outside the class and its extensions. Prefer `let` constants and `private(set)` where possible to limit mutation surface.
- **NotificationCenter observers:** Always use block-based API (`addObserver(forName:)`) that returns a token. Store the token and remove in `applicationWillTerminate` or `deinit`. Never use `addObserver(self, selector:)`.
- **Exponential backoff for device retries.** Start at 50ms, double each attempt, cap at 400ms. Never use fixed retry delays.

### SwiftLint Compliance

**Write code that passes SwiftLint without suppressions.** The project enforces strict rules via pre-commit hooks (SwiftFormat + SwiftLint). Code that requires `swiftlint:disable` comments is a smell — fix the underlying issue instead.

**Rules to follow when writing code:**

- **No force unwrapping (`!`)** — use `guard let`, `if let`, or `?? default`. The `force_unwrapping` rule is opt-in and enforced.
- **No force casting (`as!`)** — use `as?` with guard. Exception: CF bridging (AXValue, AXUIElement) where `CFGetTypeID()` verification precedes the cast — Swift has no safe alternative for CF types.
- **Function body length ≤ 60 lines** — break large functions into helpers. If a function genuinely can't be split (complex state machine, UI builder), add `// swiftlint:disable:next function_body_length` with a reason.
- **Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 15** — simplify branching or extract helper methods.
- **File length ≤ 800 lines** — split into extension files. Suppression acceptable only for static data files (seed data, templates).
- **Identifier names: 2-60 chars, no `_` prefix** on non-private properties. Use descriptive names (`downloadAndActivateInternal` not `_downloadAndActivate`).
- **Line length ≤ 150 chars** (warning), ≤ 200 chars (error).

**Acceptable suppressions (with comment explaining why):**

- `force_unwrapping` on compile-time constant `URL(string:)!` and `UUID(uuidString:)!` in seed data / static definitions
- `force_cast` on CF bridging after `CFGetTypeID()` verification (no safe alternative in Swift)
- `file_length` on static data files (seed data, built-in templates) — these are data, not logic
- `function_body_length` on complex view builders or state machines that are cohesive units

### Style

- **`guard let` for runtime URLs** — never force-unwrap URLs constructed from runtime values.
- **Prefer `@Observable` over `ObservableObject`** for new classes. Use `@State` (not `@ObservedObject`) when consuming `@Observable` singletons in views.
- **Prefer `Task.sleep` over `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter`** in SwiftUI views and async contexts. GCD is acceptable only in AppKit delegate callbacks (NSTextView, NotificationCenter block handlers) where structured concurrency doesn't apply.
- **Use `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` with `AppConstants.Delays`** — never hardcode `TimeInterval` literals in GCD calls.

## Releasing

Tagging `vX.Y.Z` runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds, signs, notarizes,
publishes, and opens a PR updating `appcast.xml`. Two things must be done by hand first,
because nothing can infer them:

- **Move `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` into `## [X.Y.Z] - <date>`.** The workflow
  extracts that section for both Sparkle's release-notes pane and the GitHub Release body.
  Forgetting falls back to `[Unreleased]`, which ships whatever is sitting there — including
  things not in the tag.
- **Append a matching block to `WhatsNewCatalog.releases`** listing only what this release
  added, illustrated cards first. The catalog is bounded by the running build, so a block for
  a version that has not been tagged stays invisible until it is — write it as the work lands.

`WhatsNewCatalog.tour`, the fresh-install list, is hand-picked and does *not* change every
release. It answers "what is this app for", not "what changed", and a newcomer handed the
upgrade deck gets a dozen cards of features they have no context for yet.

### Cutting a build for testing

Tag `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` (or `-beta.N`) instead. The workflow builds, signs and notarizes it
exactly as it would a real release and publishes it to GitHub Releases marked as a
pre-release — but it **skips the appcast step**, so nothing is offered to installed copies.

That skip is the whole point, and it is structural rather than remembered: `SUFeedURL`
points at `appcast.xml` on `main`, so an entry landing there reaches every existing user.
The version step decides pre-release once and both the GitHub Release flag and the appcast
gate read that one value, so they cannot drift apart.

Two things follow from the suffix:

- **Leave `## [Unreleased]` where it is.** No `## [X.Y.Z-rc.N]` section exists, so the
  extractor falls back to `[Unreleased]` — which is what the build is testing. Move it into
  a versioned section when cutting the real release, not before.
- **`AppVersion` orders `1.1.0-rc.1` as `1.1.0`.** The What's New pane therefore shows the
  1.1.0 cards in the RC, which is what makes them testable — and a tester who has seen them
  is not shown them again on the final build.

Testers install the RC by downloading it from its GitHub Release. It will not auto-update
to itself, and it *will* be offered the real release when that ships.
