/// putting the island away — Esc pressed in it, the close button, the shortcut —
/// has always destroyed an unsent prompt, and a conversation is what a click off
/// the island must not throw away.
///
/// `hasConversation` is *not* "has visible messages". The island owns a thread the
/// moment `ensureConversation()` runs, which is before the first reply exists and
/// before `AgentCoordinator.send` appends anything — that append happens inside a
/// `Task`, while the composer clears synchronously. Asking about visible rows left
/// a window, a frame or two wide, in which a freshly-sent island reported itself
/// completely empty and every "an empty island is disposable" rule was armed
/// against it. Clicking Send could then close the island.
///
/// `hasAttachments` exists because staged files cost more to replace than typed
/// text does. A dropped file is not recoverable by retyping it: the user found it
/// in Finder, and after a dismissal they have to find it again. It was also the
/// one kind of content the island could hold that nothing here knew about, which
/// made an empty-looking island with a PDF staged on it disposable.
