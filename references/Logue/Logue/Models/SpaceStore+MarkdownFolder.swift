/// Keeping folders in step with spaces changed inside the app.
///
/// Without this half, the two sides fight. A space renamed in the app left its folder under the
/// old name, so the next scan read the folder as the truth and renamed the space back. A space
/// deleted in the app left its folder behind, and the `_space.md` inside it still named the
/// space — so the next scan created it again. And a scan cannot tell those apart from the user
/// renaming or deleting the folder themselves; both look like a name that does not match.
///
/// So the rule is: **a structural change made in the app is written to disk immediately.** That
/// is what earns the scan the right to read a missing folder as a deletion rather than guessing.
