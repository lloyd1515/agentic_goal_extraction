/// The privacy story is the whole design. It binds to `127.0.0.1` only — not `0.0.0.0` — so
/// nothing off this machine can reach it, and it is **off until the user turns it on** in
/// Settings, because a listening socket is not something to open on everyone's behalf. Nothing it
/// serves leaves the Mac: the extension sends text in, the local model answers, the answer goes
/// back down the same loopback connection.
///
/// There is deliberately no authentication. The user asked for it to just work, and on loopback
/// the meaningful boundary is the browser's own: it sets `Origin` itself and refuses to hand a
/// response to a page that is not the extension. What that does *not* stop is another program on
/// the same Mac — which is why this is opt-in and why the port is named plainly in Settings.
