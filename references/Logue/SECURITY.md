# Security Policy

Logue is a privacy-first application: all AI inference, transcription, and data
processing runs on-device, and user data is encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM) — with one
opt-in exception: turning on plain markdown storage stores your *documents* as unencrypted
`.md` files in `~/Logue`, which the app warns about and asks you to confirm. Meetings,
transcripts and audio are always encrypted. We
take security reports seriously.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are released against the **latest** published version of Logue.
Please make sure you can reproduce an issue on the most recent release before
reporting it.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, report privately using either of the following:

- **GitHub Security Advisories** — open a private report via the
  [**Security → Report a vulnerability**](https://github.com/bitwize-ai/Logue/security/advisories/new)
  tab of this repository (preferred).
- **Email** — [support@bitwize.ai](mailto:support@bitwize.ai) with the subject
  line prefixed `[SECURITY]`.

Please include:

- a description of the issue and its potential impact;
- steps to reproduce (a proof-of-concept helps);
- affected version(s), macOS version, and Mac model;
- any suggested remediation, if you have one.

## What to expect

- We aim to **acknowledge** your report within **3 business days**.
- We will keep you updated as we investigate and work on a fix.
- Once a fix ships, we're happy to **credit** you in the release notes and any
  published advisory (let us know if you'd prefer to remain anonymous).

Please give us a reasonable opportunity to release a fix before any public
disclosure. Thank you for helping keep Logue and its users safe.
